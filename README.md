# Polling-Application
A quick and simple way to conduct an online poll using JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

## How to run:

First, you need to set up a MySQL server. The only thing required is a table named "polls".

Then, edit the "poll.php" and add the MySQL to the variables between line 51 and 55.

That's it! Now you can run the poll.php app and conduct polls.
